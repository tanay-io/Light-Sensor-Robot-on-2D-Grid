# Light Sensor Robot on 2D Grid

## Description
This project simulates a robot navigating a 2D grid by detecting and following a moving light source. It demonstrates basic robotics behavior using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, and inheritance. The project avoids the use of STL or vectors, relying solely on core logic and custom data handling.

## Features
- 2D grid-based simulation
- Robot follows the nearest light source
- Dynamic light source movement
- No STL or vectors used
- Clean OOP structure

## Technologies Used
- C++ (without STL or vectors)
- Object-Oriented Programming concepts

## How It Works
- A grid is initialized with empty cells.
- A light source moves to random or predefined positions.
- The robot detects the position of the light and moves one step at a time toward it.
- The simulation runs until the robot reaches the light or as per user-defined limits.
