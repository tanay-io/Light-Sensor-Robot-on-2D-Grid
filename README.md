# Light-Sensor-Robot-on-2D-Grid
Light Sensor Robot on 2D Grid is a simulation where a robot moves across a grid by detecting and following a light source. Built using OOP concepts like encapsulation and inheritance, the project avoids STL and vectors, focusing on core logic and custom implementation.
